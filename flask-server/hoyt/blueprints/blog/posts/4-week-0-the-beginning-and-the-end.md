Week 0: the beginning of my journey, and, _I pray_, the end of myself; a memoir.

A few weeks ago I began using [Habitica](TODO) to track my habits. For the most part, I just needed a single place to keep all my personal instructions, so I wouldn't forget what I was working on. Before months would go by before I remembered that I used to want to floss or practice [oil pulling](http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/features/oil-pulling). Now everything is conveniently together, with functionality to keep me accountable.

This past week while I was praying, the Lord told me to journal the amount of time I spent stretching, praying, and reading the Word. I believe it was either that day or the next that I read a suggestion on the [Habitica Wiki](http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Habitica_Wiki) to use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/): a time-management tool, which mostly seems to be for freelancers to calculate billable-time. Nonetheless, it seemed like a sign from Heaven to what I was just told.

So now I'm nearly reaching streaks in the double-digits, tracking my time, and some time I'd like to check out this ["Pomodoro"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)-thing; time _is_ money.

But more importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to develop my relationships with my friends and family, get out of the house, make an impact on society and my community, and bless myself with exponential spiritual growth.

So keep subscribed if you're interested in seeing the Lord Jesus Christ make and break me. :)

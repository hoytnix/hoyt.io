Here's my palette for multimedia goodness:

**Audio player: _DeaDBeeF_ **

DeaDBeeF has been able to play any encoding I throw at it. As of now I have these in my library: _mp3_, _flac_, and _mp4 aac_. I should actually have some _opus_ and _ogg_ files somewhere but I could have converted them. :)

**Video player: _SMPlayer_ **

SMPlayer has been amazing for all of my needs:
+ It's played every encoding I've had lying around: _mkv_, _webm_, _flv_, _ogg_, _vob_, _avi_, _rmvb_ (RealMedia Variable Bitrate), as well as _the mpeg-family_.
+ Subtitles have always worked seamlessly, even when they are in an external file.
+ Contains functionality for panning, zoom, translation for when videos aren't full-screen (_such as conference recordings_.

** Audio editing: _Audacity_ **

Audacity has been to go-to for audio editing and recording since I was in middle-school. It was recommended by the teacher of my computer class.

** Video editing: _Blender_ **

While I am not a 3D-modeling expert, Blender _does_ have some amazing functionality for producing videos from recordings.

** CD ripping: _Asunder_ **

It ripped my CDs with no discernible quality loss.

** Audio tagging: _Kid3_ **

Kid3 does what it's supposed to when I need to modify my audio-tags; however, it also changed itself to the default program for opening directories, so any time a program is supposed to open a folder in the file-manager it starts Kid3 now.

** Audio encoding: _SoundConverter_ **

SoundConverter supports encoding to _ogg_, _mp3_, _flac_, _wav_, _m4a_, and _opus_. The results (on appropriate settings) left no discernible quality loss, good.

** Disk burning: _K3b_ **

Although some of my CDs/DVDs may have been the problem, K3b has always produced working copies; compared to _Brasero_ or _Xfburn_ where I've had to throw out some failures. ): Also, I've never had to change the default settings, very sane.

** Image manipulation: _GIMP_ **

GIMP is the de-facto for image manipulation. Although I've never used _Photoshop_ and the editing I do doesn't use extensive special effects, GIMP has always fulfilled my needs.

I am very happy with this software and would recommend it to anyone. :)

** Color picking: _Gcolor2_ **

It's a very useful applet which can pick colors from anywhere on my screen, what more could I want?

** Photo library: _Google Photos_ **

Although this is technically a web-application, Google Photos has some amazing functionality for storing photos such as intuitive albums, history, and facial recognition using Google's AI. It also comes with 15GB of free lossless cloud storage, as well as unlimited lossy storage (_[the quality loss is indiscernible to me](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/arpit-verma/does-google-photos-compress-the-life-out-of-your-pics-heres-wh/)_).

It's artificial intelligence along with free unlimited cloud storage make it the best I could find, highly recommended.
